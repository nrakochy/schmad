# schmad
A schema adapter to convert a Clojure map to the desired schema implementation.

## Usage
See `examples` for a sample schema to use. Note: there are keys in the example map by design. It is not limited to any one schema implementation

#### Datomic
Use `schmad.datomic.adapter/generate-schema` to generate a lazy, Datomic-transactable seq, and the doc string on said method articulates the requisite params.
